# Toolkits

We often encounter problems that are often happened when using the computer to perform various tasks, such as:

- how to use `GIT` to add a sub-repository to the original repository?
- how to use `SCP` commands to download a specific file from a remote host?

For these tasks, we may not be able to recall the specific operation steps or the solutions to the problems encountered. The repo is used to record the specific steps or frequently encountered problems in using the computer to complete various tasks. It is our `cs-experience-memory` or say another cool name **`cs-problem-killer`**.
